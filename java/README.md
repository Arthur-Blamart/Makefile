# Java Makefile

## Instructions

Will compile and run your code. You have to adapt the name of the Main class in the makefile

## Rules

- **make** : compile all the sources files in classes
- **make run** : run the main class
- **make init** : creating workspace directories
- **make clean** : delete all the classes

## Directories

If each directories names can be changed in the makefile there is the default structure of the workspace :

|-src : to put your source code (.java files)

|-classes : where the classes will be created (.class files)
